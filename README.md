## Project

This was written as my final year project for Bsc Computing Science at the University of Strathclyde.

## Documentation

When building the visualisers, many abstractions and conventions were made to speed up the building of further visualiser tools. This could be thought of as a mini-framework for building more visualisers. The documentation for this can be found [here](https://marklee7916.github.io/Final-Year-Project-Documentation/).
